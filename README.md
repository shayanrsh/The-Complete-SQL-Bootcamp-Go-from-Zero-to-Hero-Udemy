This repository contains the codes and exercises that I have completed as part of the [The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) course on Udemy. This course teaches me how to use SQL to query and analyze data from various databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and more.

## What I learned 💡
- How to write SQL queries to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on data.
- How to use SQL functions and operators to manipulate and aggregate data.
- How to use SQL joins and subqueries to combine data from multiple tables.
- How to use SQL views and stored procedures to simplify and optimize queries.
- How to use SQL indexes and constraints to improve performance and data integrity.
- How to use SQL transactions and locks to ensure data consistency and concurrency.
- How to use SQL triggers and events to automate actions based on data changes.
